# Thoughts

Keeping track of what I've done and what I'm thinking each day I work on this
project.

### Done

- Defined basic grammar of WHILE language

### Questions

- Should I use infix operators to define the grammer of the language?

  - | Pros          | Cons                                 |
    | ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
    | More readable | Probably harder for pattern matching |
    |               | Harder to convert AST -> String      |

  - Maybe only for some, e.g. `Seq`, `Assign`

- Where can I start introducing dependent types?
